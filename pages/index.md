Hey, I am Thien Tran, a javascript enthusiast. I'm pursuing a career in web development. This is one of my homepages I've built to test out some new technolgies I've learned.

I am currently a freelance developer. I am an advocate of minimalist, user friendly, and helpful apps. My current favorite stack is [nextjs](https://nextjs.com), [reactjs](https://react.com), [tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com), and [MongoDB](https://mongodb.com). As a job-seeker and student, I'm always curious and trying out new technologies.

This site is built with [vite](https://vitejs.com) and [vue3](https://vue3.com). Take a look around and let me know what you think or just have a a chat.
